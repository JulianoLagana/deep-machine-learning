# Instructions

This directory holds guides for various tools / environments that will be used throughout the course. They may make most sense to read in the order they are numbered, but also hold some cross-references to each other.

### A couple of notes on the cloud providers

As you can see, there are separate cloud instructions for Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform.
Google cloud seems to have good availability whereas for Azure it is virtually impossible to get a GPU due to the current component shortage.
We therefore _strongly_ recommend that you start out with Google Cloud.

To mitigate the GPU shortage:

- We will publish HA1 two weeks before the deadline rather than the ususal one week.
- You are advised to, as early as possible, setup a Google Cloud instance.
  You do not need it before HA1, but it is wise to have it set up before HA1 is released.
