# Instructions for setting up the course environment

## Download & install Anaconda
1. Download Anaconda Python 3.7 from https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/
1. Run the installer, but first read through **all** of the below remarks.
  - If on Windows, you might need to run the downloaded installation file as administrator, depending on choice of installation directory (right-click the file, and click "Run as administrator").
  - Do not use the default installation path, if it contains spaces or other special characters. We do not know exactly when this could turn out to be an issue, but it is discouraged by Anaconda (more info [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/faq/#distribution-faq-windows-folder)). For instance, if John Doe ran the installer, the default path might be `C:\Users\John Doe\Anaconda3`, which could be an issue since his username has a space in it. An alternative would be `C:\anaconda3`, although this would probably require you to run the installation as administrator.
  - During the installation, make sure to select the option to add Anaconda to your PATH environment variable. As far as we know, this is usually not recommended by Anaconda and thus deselected by default.
  - You do not need to "Register Anaconda as the default/system Python 3.7"
1. After installation, run the command `conda init` (or optionally `conda init <SHELL_OF_YOUR_CHOICE>`), in order to setup conda to work properly with your command-line interpreter (terminal). You may have been asked for the `conda init` step to be automatically carried out during installation, but if not it is essential that you do it manually, in order to be able to activate your Conda environment later.
1. Close all terminal windows currently open (the `conda init` step above will not have any effect on existing terminal windows - only on new ones).

## Install Git and clone course repository
1. Install Git, https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git.
1. Start up a terminal (On Windows, use Powershell)
1. Clone the course GitHub repo, by the following command (this creates a folder in your current directory with the necessary files for the next instructions): `git clone https://github.com/JulianoLagana/deep-machine-learning.git`

## Keeping the repo in sync
Cloning a repo creates a local copy of the Github repo on your computer. Whenever new changes are uplooaded, or *pushed*,
to the Github repo you can get the new changes by *pulling* them to your local version with the `git pull` command.
If you have made changes in the same files as the new version on Github, there could be a conflict and git would not be able to automatically *merge* the changes.
There are a few ways to handle this, see [separate instructions](https://github.com/JulianoLagana/deep-machine-learning/blob/master/instructions/04_keep_git_repo_in_sync.md).

## Create a Conda environment and install Python dependencies
1. Navigate to the folder created by the cloning, using the command `cd`, followed by the directory's name.
1. Create the Conda environment for the course by typing
   ```
   conda env create -f conda-environment-files/conda-environment-cpu-<x>.yml
   ```
   , where you substitute the `<x>` by either `unix` or `win`, depending if you're following the instructions in a unix machine (Linux, Mac, etc), or a Windows one.
1. Wait for the installations to complete, and make sure there were no errors.

## Activating and testing the Conda environment
1. Now, you have created a virtual Conda environment with all Python dependencies installed.
   Still, in order to get access to this environment, you must activate it.
   This has to be done every time you start up a new terminal window.
   Activate it by the command `conda activate dml`.
1. You should now see `(dml)` printed at the start of every row in the terminal, indicating, that the `dml` environment is activated. If this does not happen, most probably the `conda init` step was not carried out successfully during installation.
1. Now you can start using Jupyter notebook. To do so, type `jupyter notebook`. Your web browser should automatically open up and navigate to http://localhost:8888, letting you access Jupyter.
1. Please have a look at the two Jupyter notebooks, *testing_notebook.ipynb* and *Getting started with JN.ipynb*, available in the folder [`python-crash-course`](https://github.com/JulianoLagana/deep-machine-learning/tree/master/python-crash-course). The first file checks if the installation was successful, whereas the second file give you initial advices regarding how to use Jupyter notebooks.
1. To deactivate the conda environment, you simply type `conda deactivate`.

### Update the Conda environment
**Note:** This is important!

Make sure that your Conda environment is always up-to-date with the latest environment file available from the GitHub repo. We will try to make a Canvas announcement whenever it is updated.

How to update the Conda environment:
- Navigate to the git repo you have cloned.
- Make sure that you have the latest version of the repo.
- Make sure the conda environment is deactivated (see above).
- Type e.g. `conda env update -f conda-environment-files/conda-environment-cpu-win.yml --prune`. Note however that the appropriate environment file to be used varies depending on your system. See section below for more info.
- Now you can activate the environment again.

## CPU / GPU and Windows / Unix conda environment files
On GitHub, there are different conda environment files intended for CPU / GPU as well as Windows / Unix platforms:
- `conda-environment-cpu-win.yml`
- `conda-environment-cpu-unix.yml`
- `conda-environment-gpu-win.yml`
- `conda-environment-gpu-unix.yml`

If, while working in the cloud, you have reason to update the (pre-installed) conda environment, the `conda-environment-gpu-unix.yml` file is always to be used.

When working on your own computer however, you should use the `win` rather than `unix` version if you are running Windows rather than Mac / Linux / etc. In this case, the `cpu` version should typically be used. If you have a compatible Nvidia GPU, you can however try to make use of it by simply using the `gpu` version instead, and hopefully this will work well. It can however be quite a hassle to properly install a GPU-enabled deep learning environment, and we do not have the resources to help you out here.
