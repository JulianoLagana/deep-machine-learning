    "In this notebook, we will focus on how to use it. First of all, notebooks contain cells that are primarily of two types:\n",
    "- Markdown: where we can write formatted text like this. The cell you are reading right now is such a Markdown cell. You can read the Markdown source code by double clicking in the cell. To return to the formatted text, you simply run the cell (see below). You can learn more about Markdown [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/).\n",
    "- Code: where you can write code. The code is then executed using a kernel designed to run Python code.\n",
