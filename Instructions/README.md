# Instructions
This directory holds guides for various tools / environments that will be used throughout the course. They may make most sense to read in the order they are numbered, but also hold some cross-references to each other.

Note however, that steps 1-3 in [03_using_google_cloud.md](03_using_google_cloud.md) should ideally be done a couple of days before starting working with HA1.
