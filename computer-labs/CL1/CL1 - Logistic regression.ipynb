    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Data exploration\n",
    "The first step is normally to load the data and try to understand its properties. A few things that are usually useful:\n",
    "1. Check data formats.\n",
    "2. Visual inspection of data.\n",
    "3. Investigate (get some type of understanding for) how hard the problem is. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Data preprocessing\n",
    "1. Normalise (or scale) input data. \n",
    "2. Convert the data to a different type, or organize it differently for the optimization (e.g. Numpy arrays, subsets of the dataset, etc.)\n",
    "3. Encode input and output data on a suitable form. For instance, we often use one-hot encoding to represent string variables.\n",
    "4. Split data into training, validation and test sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Training\n",
    "1. Build a tentative network architecture (could be the simplest one you think could work, or based in previous sucesses).\n",
    "2. Select optimizer, performance measures and a few more hyperparameters. \n",
    "3. Train the network. \n",
    "4. Analyze performance on the training and validation sets. Adjust design decisions accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Assesment\n",
    "1. Use the network for predictions in the test set.\n",
    "2. Evaluate the final quality of the model. **Attention**: Once this is done, you shouldn't alter your model anymore, otherwise you need a new test set (if you want a good estimate of your model's generalization capacity)."
